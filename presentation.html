# About R

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. (Ref: [`r-project.org`](https://www.r-project.org/about.html))

- R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand

- R is Free

- R can be extended (easily) via *packages*.

- R is an interpreted language

# Basics of R Programming

---

# Hello, World!


The traditional first step - **Hello, World!**:

--


```r
*print("Hello, World!")
```

```
## [1] "Hello, World!"
```

&lt;br/&gt;

###.center[That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind]

# Arithmetic Operations


```r
2 + 3
```

```
## [1] 5
```


```r
50000 * 42222
```

```
## [1] 2111100000
```


```r
2304 / 233
```

```
## [1] 9.888412
```


```r
(33 + 44 ) * 232 / 12
```

```
## [1] 1488.667
```

---

# Assignment Operators

### .center[`&lt;-` **Arrow (Less-than &lt; and Minus - )**]

### .center[`=` **(Equal Sign)**]


```r
(x &lt;- 2 + 3)
```

```
## [1] 5
```



```r
*(y = x ** 4)
```

```
## [1] 625
```


```r
5 * 9 -&gt; a
a + 3
```

```
## [1] 48
```

---



# Objects

* The entities R operates on are technically known as `objects`.

Example: Vector of numeric



```r
vector_of_numeric &lt;- c(2,4,5)

typeof(vector_of_numeric)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

---

# Vectors

- Atomic Vectors - Homogeneous Data Type

  - logical
  - integer
  - double
  - character
  - *complex*
  - *raw*

- Lists - (Recursive Vectors) Heterogeneous Data Type 

- `NULL` is used to represent absence of a vector

**Vectors + Attributes (Additional Meta Data) = Augmented vectors**

* Factors are built on top of integer vectors.
* Dates and date-times are built on top of numeric vectors.
* Data frames and tibbles are built on top of lists.


---

### Numeric Vector


```r
nummy &lt;- c(2,3,4)

nummy_int &lt;- c(1L,2L,3L)  
```



```r
typeof(nummy)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

```r
typeof(nummy_int)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```


```r
is.numeric(nummy)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.numeric(nummy_int)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.double(nummy)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
is.double(nummy_int)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```


---

### Character Vector


```r
types &lt;- c("int","double","character")

types
```

```
## [1] "int"       "double"    "character"
```



```r
typeof(types)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
length(types)
```

```
## [1] 3
```


```r
is.numeric(types)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
is.character(types)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```
---

### Logical Vector


```r
logicals &lt;- c(TRUE,F,TRUE,T, FALSE)

logicals
```

```
## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```
---

# Coersion 

## Typecasting - Explicit



```r
money_in_chars &lt;- c("20","35","33")

typeof(money_in_chars)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```


```r
money_money &lt;- as.numeric(money_in_chars)

money_money
```

```
## [1] 20 35 33
```

```r
typeof(money_money)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

---

## Typecasting - Implicit


```r
money_money &lt;- as.numeric(money_in_chars)

money_money
```

```
## [1] 20 35 33
```

```r
typeof(money_money)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```


```r
new_money &lt;- c(money_money,"33")

new_money
```

```
## [1] "20" "35" "33" "33"
```

```r
typeof(new_money)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

# Vector Manipulation

## Appending


```r
days &lt;- c("Mon","Tue","Wed")

days
```

```
## [1] "Mon" "Tue" "Wed"
```


```r
week_end &lt;- c("Sat","Sun")

more_days &lt;- c(days,"Thu","Fri",week_end)

more_days
```

```

# Vector - Arithmetic


```r
set.seed(122)

so_many_numbers &lt;- runif(10, min = 10, max = 100)

so_many_numbers
```

```
##  [1] 91.45185 91.61657 27.14995 13.68211 62.11661 66.31451 71.14383
##  [8] 10.25104 13.21914 63.69918
```


```r
so_many_numbers * 200
```

```
##  [1] 18290.370 18323.314  5429.989  2736.422 12423.322 13262.902 14228.767
##  [8]  2050.209  2643.828 12739.836
```

# Factors

* In R, factors are used to work with categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values.

* Useful with Characters where non-Alphabetical Ordering is required


```r
days &lt;- c("Thu","Wed","Sun")

sort(days)
```

```
## [1] "Sun" "Thu" "Wed"
```



```r
week_levels &lt;- c("Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun")


(days_f &lt;- factor(days, levels = week_levels))
```

```
## [1] Thu Wed Sun
## Levels: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
```


```r
sort(days_f)  
```

```
## [1] Wed Thu Sun
## Levels: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
```

---

# List

Lists are a step up in complexity from atomic vectors: each element can be any type, not just vectors. 


```r
(a_list &lt;- list("abcd",123,1:12,month.abb))
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "abcd"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 123
## 
## [[3]]
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
## 
## [[4]]
##  [1] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" "May" "Jun" "Jul" "Aug" "Sep" "Oct" "Nov"
## [12] "Dec"
```
---

# List Accessing


```r
a_list[[1]]
```

```
## [1] "abcd"
```

```r
a_list[[4]][4]
```

```
## [1] "Apr"
```


---

# Matrix


```r
new_m &lt;- matrix(data = 1:12, nrow = 3)

new_m
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,]    1    4    7   10
## [2,]    2    5    8   11
## [3,]    3    6    9   12
```


```r
new_m * 20
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,]   20   80  140  200
## [2,]   40  100  160  220
## [3,]   60  120  180  240
```



```r
dim(new_m)
```

```
## [1] 3 4
```

```r
new_m[2,3]
```

```
## [1] 8
```

# Dataframe

## Tabular Structure 

* dimension 
* row.names
* col.names



```r
colleges &lt;- c("CIT","GCT","PSG")

year &lt;- c(2019,2018,2017)

db &lt;- data.frame(college_names = colleges, year_since = year)

db
```

```

```


```r
db[,"year_since"]
```

```
## [1] 2019 1990 2017
```

# Loops &amp; Iterators

## For Loop


```r
for (month_name in month.abb[1:4]) {
  print(paste("This month", month_name, "beautiful!!!"))
}
```

```
## [1] "This month Jan beautiful!!!"
## [1] "This month Feb beautiful!!!"
## [1] "This month Mar beautiful!!!"
## [1] "This month Apr beautiful!!!"
```

# Data Science Framework


There are now like, you know, a billion venn diagrams showing you what data science is. But to me I think the definition is pretty simple. Whenever you're struggling with data, trying to understand what's going on with data, whenever you're trying to turn that **raw data into insight and understanding and discoveries**. I think that's **Data Science.**" - Hadley Wickham

# Data Questions (Business Problem)

- What's the percentage of Male and Female respondents?

- What are the top 5 countries?

---

# dyplr verbs

- `mutate()` - adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
- `select()` - picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` - picks cases based on their values.
- `summarise()` - reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()` - changes the ordering of the rows.

# Introducing %&gt;% Pipe Operator

- The pipe, `%&gt;%`, comes from the magrittr package by Stefan Milton Bache

- **Output of LHS** is given as the **input (first argument) of RHS**

### Example


```r
kaggle %&gt;% dim()
```

```
## [1] 23859   395
```

Although doesn't make much sense to use `%&gt;%` in this context, Hope it explains the function.

# Percentage of Male and Female

* Column name - `What is your gender? - Selected Choice`

### Pseudo-code

- `group_by` the `kaggle` dataframe on column `What is your gender? - Selected Choice`
- `count` the values 
-  calculate `percentage` value from the `count`s

# Top 5 Countries

* Column name - `In which country do you currently reside?`


### Pseudo-code

- `count` number of respondents from each country
- `arrange` countries in descending order based on their count value
- `top 5` in the list is the output
